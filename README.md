So we are gonna do some customer analysis today.

But before we get started, we have to know couple of things:

                ---> Know your audience (I am assuming my audience as a marketing team, executive management team, research team)
                ---> Get Relevant datasets
                ---> Chhose the right analysis (Descriptive, predictive, prescriptive)
                ---> Chhose the right charts With meaning dashboards (As there are 44 charts avaliable in Tableau)
               
Tasks To do:

                ---> Revenue Per State
                ---> Revenue based on month of the year
                ---> Revenue based on ages
                ---> Quantity - Discount Percentage correlation
                ---> Percentage of Revenue Per Region
                ---> Revenue Per Category Per Gender
                ---> Build the dashboard or story (Your Choice ğŸ˜€)
